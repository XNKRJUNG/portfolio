    description: "I had the great pleasure of working closely with Yogesh. I was really impressed by his ability and talent when it comes to front-end and React.JS. During the projects we contributed to, he was always sharp and modern in creating the UI identity of our applications from scratch. Depending on what was needed, he could bring up layouts that were more minimalist or full of animations and details, without compromising the user experience. In addition to that, he quickly grasped backend concepts and applied them in the projects, making me see him as a complete professional. Ultimately, along with the technical results he brought, he made the work environment easier due to his personality. I strongly recommend him for any job as front-end and full-stack developer."
